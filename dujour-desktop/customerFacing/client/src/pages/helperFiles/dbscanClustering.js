/*
What is DBSCAN?
Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) is a clustering algorithm that creates clusters based on
the density of data points in a region. It requires two parameters: 
	1. Ïµ (eps), the maximum distance between two points for one to be considered as in the neighborhood of the other
	2. minPts, the minimum number of points to form a dense region. DBSCAN can identify clusters of varying shapes and sizes
	   and is good at separating noise from clusters.

Application for Address Grouping:
DBSCAN is particularly useful for geographical clustering because it doesn't require specifying the number of clusters
beforehand and can handle outliers well.

Basic DBSCAN Function:
Implementing DBSCAN from scratch is more complex due to its density-based nature.

 * @return {Array} An array of clusters, each cluster is an array of points. Points not belonging to any cluster are considered noise.
